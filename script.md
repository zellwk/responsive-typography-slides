## Intro
Typography is one of the most important things about web design. As web developers, we cannot ignore typography. However, learning to deal with typography is different because there are two aspects to typography. There's the design aspects and there's the code aspects.

These two fields are completely separate. We need to rewrite our brains to learn from the two different fields. It's hard, and that's why many designs don't know how to code and many developers don't know how to design.

Even though we want to learn about the other field, we may not necessarily have the time to dig into it. And if we can't understand both typography and code, we can't deal with responsive typography effectively. We won't be able to write clean code.

Thankfully, it's not so hard to get the basics to both sides of typography, and that's what we're doing today.

## Today

## What is good typography

- To understand what good typography is, we have to understand it's purpose first. So what's its purpose?
- Typography helps text communicate
- In other words, good typography helps readers immerse themselves in text
- It removes distractions
- It communicates the right emotions (or lack of emotions)

## Determining Font-size

- font-size is too small if:
  + You have to squint your eyes
  + You have to zoom in to read
- You know the font-size is too big if:
  + You notice letters instead of reading the content
  + You can only read 1-3 words at a time
  + You get frustrated while trying to read fast


## Determining Measure

- the measure is too short if:
  + You feel irritated that the text broke when you built up a comfortable reading speed.
  + Your eyes get tired from bouncing to the left and right rapidly.

- The measure if too long if:
  + You had to turn your head while reading the text
  + You lose concentration midway halfway into the line


## Determining Leading

- leading is too small if:
  + The text feels dense and overwhelming
  + read the wrong line of text accidentally.

- You know the leading is too large if:
  + You get distracted by the whitespace


## Leading affected by other properties

Smaller Leading if
- The typeface has a smaller x-height
- The font-size is large
- The measure is short
